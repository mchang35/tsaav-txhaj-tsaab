    <p> asdjfkal sa whole bunch of random crap Document.getElementById()
        The Document method getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.

        If you need to get access to an element which doesn't have an ID, you can use querySelector() to find the element using any selector.

        Syntax
        var element = document.getElementById(id);
        Copy to Clipboard
        Parameters
        id
        The ID of the element to locate. The ID is case-sensitive string which is unique within the document; only one element may have any given ID.

        Return value
        An Element object describing the DOM element object matching the specified ID, or null if no matching element was found in the document.

        Example
        HTML
        Copy to Clipboard
        JavaScript
        function changeColor(newColor) {
        var elem = document.getElementById('para');
        elem.style.color = newColor;
        }
        Copy to Clipboard
        Result

        Usage notes
        The capitalization of "Id" in the name of this method must be correct for the code to function; getElementByID() is not valid and will not work, however natural it may seem.

        Unlike some other element-lookup methods such as Document.querySelector() and Document.querySelectorAll(), getElementById() is only available as a method of the global document object, and not available as a method on all element objects in the DOM. Because ID values must be unique throughout the entire document, there is no need for "local" versions of the function.

        Example
        Copy to Clipboard
        If there is no element with the given id, this function returns null. Note that the id parameter is case-sensitive, so document.getElementById("Main") will return null instead of the element  because "M" and "m" are different for the purposes of this method.

    Elements not in the document are not searched by getElementById(). When creating an element and assigning it an ID, you have to insert the element into the document tree with Node.insertBefore() or a similar method before you can access it with getElementById():

    var element = document.createElement('div');
    element.id = 'testqq';
    var el = document.getElementById('testqq'); // el will be null!
    Copy to Clipboard
    Non-HTML documents. The DOM implementation must have information that says which attributes are of type ID. Attributes with the name "id" are not of type ID unless so defined in the document's DTD. The id attribute is defined to be of ID type in the common cases of XHTML, XUL, and other. Implementations that do not know whether attributes are of type ID or not are expected to return null.
